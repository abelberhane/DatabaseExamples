# Database Examples

While I am starting to really work with Databases and utilizing them in programming, I want to start to have a group of reliable Database
examples I can work with. I will be creating databases ranging from movies, customers, employees, and other common examples. 

The databases 
will be used with programs that I test and practice with. Feel free to utilize the databases once I get them created and added to this 
repository. The first one that I have uploaded is just the Create script for the Movies Database. I plan on having Folders structured
to include the Create and Insert scripts in each respective project.
